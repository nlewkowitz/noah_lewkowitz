[{"content":"This is my first post. It has been a frustrating journey to get to this point with Hugo and Git, but I\u0026rsquo;m determined to make this work. So far I have learned how to install Hugo on my computer using Homebrew. After installing Hugo, I then began learning how to use the Terminal to access files on the computer. So far I have used the cd, ls, git init, and git clone commands with varying levels of success.\nWill this make a new line? Apparently the answer to that question is yes, it will make a new line simply by adding a line in the text file in Atom. I\u0026rsquo;ve also had to download Atom to my Mac in order to help me edit the different types of files required to operate this website.\nI\u0026rsquo;m still learning quite a bit, and my next goal is to host the website so others can see it. As of now, I am writing this simply as a website stored locally and connected to my git repo.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2025/02/25_0210/","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;ve been more frustrated before, but not often.","title":"My First Post"}]
